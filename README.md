# Project Name
3D RPG Target Shooter

In this game you play as a somone who is looking to join a group, and to be let in you must take a special test. In this test you must shoot down all the targets to gain points. There are drones flying around that will deduct points if they catch you, but you can destroy them to get rid of them and gain more points. This test is timed, but instead of instantly failing you will just lose a large number of points for not completing within the time given. 

##   Implementation
Multiple targets to shoot
Drones to avoid and shoot
